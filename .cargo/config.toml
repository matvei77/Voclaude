# Build configuration for Voclaude
# Sets CUDA environment for whisper-rs-sys cmake build

# Note: These environment variables are platform-specific.
# On Linux, CUDA is typically found automatically at /usr/local/cuda

# Use CUDA 12.8 (not 13.1 which has linking issues)

# Use Ninja generator to avoid VS CUDA integration issues

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.env]
# Linux typically auto-detects CUDA at /usr/local/cuda
# Uncomment if you have CUDA in a non-standard location:
